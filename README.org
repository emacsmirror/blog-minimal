** Introduction
   Blog-minimal is a simple static site generator based on org mode.

** Presentation
   This is my [[https://thiefuniverse.github.io][blog]] generated by blog-minimal. The theme is inspired by [[http://orderedlist.com/minimal/][minimal]].
** Usage
*** load package
    Move this package to your lisp load-path.
*** config your blog main directory
    You can use *M-x customize-group* for blog-minimal avriable configuration (also you
can invoke function *M-x bm/change-vars* to change variables. ( I suppose that you can 
just config your *bm/blog-main-dir* and then invoke *bm/preview-blog* to get a preview.)
